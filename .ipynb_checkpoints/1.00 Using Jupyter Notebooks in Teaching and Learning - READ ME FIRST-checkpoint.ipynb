    "# Using Jupyter Notebooks in Teaching and Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "*Welcome to the world of Jupyter notebooks.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks provide a literate programming, browser based interface and interactive development environment for a wide range of computer languages. However, they can also be used to support the reproducible production of a wide range of interactive materials and rich web based content with little - or no - programming language knowledge required.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main aims of these notebooks is to show how academic authors can use the notebooks to generate their own interactive activities, as well as create their own media assets, based on direct observation, and simple editing, of the provided examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "In later notebooks, you will see how it is possible to \"write\" a text based description of a wide range of diagram types that can be automatically rendered to a finished graphical object, appropriate either for print or web delivery. Scientific charts can also be scripted to visualise a wide range of data sets; many of these chart objects are capable of being styled without affecting the \"content\" of the chart, in much the same way that a web page can be styled in terms of font style and size, colouring, emphasis, and layout. The same chart objects can also be rendered as high quality charts for print display, or interactive charts more appopraite for the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "If it's embedded interactive - or static - maps you want, or embedded audio players, they can be added quite straightforwardly too.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebooks embrace one of the original ideas of the web in that running notebooks are \"read / writable\". Not only do they render as HTML web pages, but you can also edit them directly, even more directly than many wiki pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The live editing and rendering of pages means that authors can quickly update pages and see exactly how that affects the finished document.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interactive support means that notebooks allow course team members to directly author interactive activities that can be rendered in the notebooks and then used by students, as well as allowing students to create their own interactives, or write, execute and observe the output of their own code.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are not a programmer, or don't consider yourself to be a programmer, __DON'T PANIC__. The notebooks demonstrate how you can make minor changes to the provided code in order to make meaningful changes to created objects, as well hinting at some of the more elaborate interactives that a more experienced programmer is likely to be able to produce quite rapidly."

    "## Markdown\n",
    "Markdown cells contain *markdown*, which is a simplified markup language. Double click this cell in a running notebook to enter the cell edit mode to see the raw markdown. You may notice it reads sensibly as \"annotated\" text - *emphasised* elements, __strongly emphasised__ elements, as well as when rendered as HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "(We will show you later how you can enable a rich, WYSIWYG editor as a notebook extension; but at the end of the day, writing simple markdown to create the majority of simple document stucturing and styling effects you are most likely to use is not really that hard to pick up at all!)\n",

(There are keyboard shortcuts to do this too - `ESC-m` converts a code cell to a markdown cell.)\n",
